            <p>For most people who have not been exposed to vinyl records, the experience that they have had to the medium would likely be limited to what they've seen in popular media. 
                They see a big black disk get placed onto a machine, it starts spinning, and them boom. Music starts to play</p>

            <!-- <p>People unfamiliar with older mediums of data storage are likely to assume that vinyls work similarly to how modern discs work. In which data is stored within the disc itself, and it is transmitted using light.
                After all, they are both the same shape right? Well this isn't actually that farfetched of an assumption. Vinyl records have a cousin, known as laserdiscs, which are the predecessor of modern day CDs and DvDs.
                Rather than being a medium for music, hoever, laserdiscs were meant for movies. But in reality, vinyl records do not use light to transmit data. So how do they work then?

              <p>People unfamiliar with older mediums of data storage are likely to assume that vinyls work similarly to how modern discs work, in which data is stored digitally.
                In these types of storage medium, data is magnetically stored in bits as 1s and 0s. The way this data is read however, can vary. Those who have seen the inner operations of 
                a harddisk may find a strong comparison with vinyl records. They both have a spinning disc, and a moveable arm. So is that it then? Do vinyls work like HDDs in that data is transmitted through
                light? <br><br>Nope.

                Vinyl records are actually an analog medium, meaning that the audio itself is physcially stored directly onto the vinyl. There are no bits or ones and zeroes. Instead, the "data" is actually stored as small grooves that 
                are engraved into the material itself. These grooves form the actual vibrations of the music. In fact, you can still hear music from a vinyl record even without plugging in speakers,
                So how is it played? All record players have an arm with a tiny needle
                It is so tiny in fact, taht some people with poor eyesight may not even be able to see the needle. When a vinyl is played, a motor drives the plate that 
                the vinyl is placed on to spin, conversely causing the vinyl to spin. The needle is then forced to move along the grooves, causing the needle itself to vibrate. These vibrations are detected
               by magnets, which in turn output an analog audio signal
